Title: "DeepLab: Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets, Atrous Convolution, and Fully Connected CRFs"

## Challenges
There are 3 challenges in segmentation using Deep CNNs
- reduced feature resolutions due to presence of multiple max-pooling and striding(downsampling). Feature maps resulting from this have reduced feature resolutions. [Solution]: instead of downsampling, use Upsampling to increase resolution in last few layers. (Atrous Convolution + bilinear interpolation) to recover original image resolution.  
- multiple scales objects present in image. [Solution]: Using Atrous spatial pyramid pooling, multiple filters are used to collect complementary field of view as a result capture multiple scales, including context and object.
- presence of DCNN invariance reduces localization accuracy. [Solution]: use of fully connected CRF to assimilate fine details.

## Advantages
Finally, some advantages of DeepLab
- high speed of 8 FPS.
- state-of-art accuracy.
- simple structure.
